Numbers in brackets show the metrics relative to the Hub ensemble (i.e. the median ensemble of all other models submitted to the German and Polish Forecast Hub, excluding our contributions). WIS is the mean weighted interval score (lower values are better), WIS - sd is the standard deviation of all scores achieved by a model. Dispersion, over-prediction and under-prediction together sum up to the weighted interval score.
